### Private Sector Biotechnology Research

Since transitioning into the private sector in biotechnology, Dr. Ryan Bartelme has been involved in various innovative research projects. However, due to the sensitive nature of this work and existing nondisclosure agreements, the specific details of these projects cannot be publicly shared. This constraint underscores the commitment to maintaining the highest standards of confidentiality and integrity in research.

### Modeling *Sorghum bicolor* Phenotypes with Bayesian Belief Networks

This [project](https://github.com/genophenoenvo/phenophasebbn) was a part of the [GenoPhenoEnvo NSF HDR award](https://genophenoenvo.github.io/). It involved developing a simplified proof of concept model in the R language, utilizing the `bnlearn` library to construct diacyclic graphs for the phenotypic, genomic, and environmental data from the [TERRA-REF Project](https://www.terraref.org/). The project expanded to experiment with the NO-TEARS DAG solving algorithm. However, it was ultimately unsuccessful in resolving the directed graph structure with this implementation. Despite the project not achieving its intended outcome, it provided significant insights into Bayesian statistics and highlighted how directed acyclic graph structure solving algorithms remain an active area of research.

### Microbial Communities in Controlled Environment Agriculture Systems

As a trained microbial ecologist and microbiologist, I am deeply interested in the functioning of microbial communities. My doctoral research concentrated on the microbiomes of recirculating aquaculture systems and aquaponics. Previous work in this area is detailed [here](publications.html). This is an ongoing interest, and I am actively seeking funding to further this research.

### Online Short-Course in Statistics

Developed for the [University of Arizona Data Science Fellows Program](https://datascience.arizona.edu/data-science-fellows/), [this course](https://github.com/rbartelme/rstudio-stats/) leverages the [CyVerse Discovery Environment](https://de.cyverse.org/de/) and [docker](https://www.docker.com/) to provide postdoctoral researchers in computer science and biology with an introduction to statistical analysis in R. Topics include basic regression, distribution modeling, Markov chains, and Bayesian Belief Networks.
