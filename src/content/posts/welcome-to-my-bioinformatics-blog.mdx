# Welcome to My Bioinformatics Blog

I'm excited to launch this blog as a platform to share insights from my work in bioinformatics, data science, and sustainable agriculture. As a Bioinformatic Scientist at Pivot Bio, I'm constantly exploring the intersection of computational biology and real-world agricultural challenges.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog will cover several key areas where I spend my research time:

### ðŸ§¬ Bioinformatics Methodologies

I'll share practical approaches to analyzing biological data, from sequence analysis to phylogenetic reconstruction. Expect tutorials, code examples, and discussions of best practices.

### ðŸ“Š Data Science in Agriculture

Working at Pivot Bio has given me unique insights into how data science can address agricultural challenges. I'll explore statistical methods, machine learning applications, and data visualization techniques.

<Alert type="info" title="Research Focus">
My current work focuses on developing sustainable nitrogen solutions through computational approaches that combine microbial ecology with agricultural data science.

### ðŸŒ± Sustainable Solutions

The future of agriculture depends on sustainable practices backed by solid science. I'll discuss how computational approaches can help us understand and optimize biological systems for sustainable farming.

## Interactive Content

One of the exciting aspects of moving from Jekyll to Next.js + MDX is the ability to create interactive content. Here's a simple example of how we can visualize data:

<ScatterPlot 
  data={[
    {x: 2.3, y: 0.001, label: "Gene A", category: "Upregulated"},
    {x: -1.8, y: 0.01, label: "Gene B", category: "Downregulated"},
    {x: 3.2, y: 0.0001, label: "Gene C", category: "Upregulated"},
    {x: 0.1, y: 0.5, label: "Gene D", category: "No change"},
    {x: -2.1, y: 0.005, label: "Gene E", category: "Downregulated"}
  ]}
  xLabel="Log2 Fold Change"
  yLabel="P-value"

## My Background

My journey in bioinformatics began with my doctoral work in Freshwater Science at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, where I studied microbial communities in recirculating aquaculture systems. This interdisciplinary foundation, spanning microbiology, ecology, and computational biology, has shaped my approach to tackling complex biological problems.

<Alert type="success" title="Educational Philosophy">
I believe the best way to learn bioinformatics is through practical application. Throughout this blog, I'll emphasize hands-on examples and real-world case studies.
