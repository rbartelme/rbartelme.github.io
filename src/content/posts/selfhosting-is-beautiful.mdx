abstract: "Self-hosting—running your own services on hardware you control—offers a DIY path to digital autonomy. From firewalls and home automation to NAS systems and git servers, the spectrum of possibilities is vast. This post explores what self-hosting means, shares personal experiences from academia to home labs, and honestly examines the trade-offs. Whether you want to fight platform enshittification, own your data, or just tinker with hardware for fun, self-hosting rewards curiosity and patience in equal measure."

# Introduction

Sometimes I feel extremely fortunate I grew up in a very Do-It-Yourself (DIY) family and discovered the DIY music scene in my hometown.
All these experiences showed me at a young age that you can bootstrap and will most things into existence.
I sit here writing this introduction to the soundtrack of [Fugazi Live in Houston 1996](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSJjNAQgG3g).
Their vocalist/guitarist Ian MacKaye started [Dischord Records](https://dischord.com/) with Jeff Nelson out of their home in the Washington DC metro area.
Fugazi never charged more than $5 for a show, and their concerts were all-ages to give young kids a third space and something to do.
To me, the analogy here is that with enough time, learning, and sweat equity, you can DIY pretty much anything.
The real crux of it all is figuring out when it is worth doing something yourself.
Starting a band, a business, or any technical or creative project requires a certain amount of DIY willingness on some level.
Maybe for technological projects, you want to self-host services to fight the [enshittification of the internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification), own more of your own data, and learn a little something along the way.
All roads lead to DIY from here, it's just a matter of how deep down the beautiful black hole you want to go.
Just don't cross the [Schwarzschild Radius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius) too lightly—self-hosting is liberating, befuddling, and sometimes just plain fun.


# What Is Self-Hosting

At its core, self-hosting means running and maintaining your own services on hardware you own or control, rather than relying on third-party providers.
Instead of using Google Drive, you might run [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) on a server in your closet.
Instead of paying for a streaming service, you might set up [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) or [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/) to serve your own media library.
The spectrum ranges from simple single-board computer projects to full-blown server racks.

**Networking and Firewalls**: Most self-hosting journeys start with taking control of your home network. Consumer routers from ISPs are often limited in features, security, and configurability. Open-source firewall solutions like [OPNsense](https://opnsense.org/) or [pfSense](https://www.pfsense.org/) running on dedicated hardware give you fine-grained control over your network traffic, VPN capabilities, ad-blocking at the DNS level, and intrusion detection.

**Home Automation**: Smart home devices from major manufacturers often require cloud connectivity, phone home with your usage data, and can become e-waste when the company decides to sunset support. Self-hosted alternatives like [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) give you local control over your smart devices. Combined with [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/), you can even build your own sensors and switches using inexpensive microcontrollers.

**Home Security**: Commercial security systems often come with monthly subscription fees and cloud dependencies. Self-hosted solutions like [Frigate](https://frigate.video/) for network video recording give you local storage and AI-powered detection without sending your camera feeds to someone else's servers.

**Weather Stations**: For the data-curious, personal weather stations with tools like [Weewx](https://weewx.com/) let you collect hyperlocal environmental data. It's a fun entry point into self-hosting that combines hardware tinkering with data visualization.

**Data Backups and NAS**: Network Attached Storage (NAS) systems are perhaps the most practical self-hosting gateway. Solutions like [TrueNAS](https://www.truenas.com/) turn old hardware into robust storage servers with features like ZFS, RAID, and automated backups. Owning your data means not worrying about a cloud provider changing their pricing or terms of service overnight.

# My Experiences Self-Hosting at Home & Work

I was fortunate enough to be present in places that gradually filled my self-hosting toolbox over my life and career.
Grad school reinvigorated my curiosity in computation as a science and led me on the path I walk today.
Circumstance led me on a path to the Tucson [Arizona Research Bazaar](https://researchbazaar.arizona.edu/) organization, which eventually led to my working for an NSF cloud computing project as an educator.
I was rapidly exposed to more modern cyber infrastructure than I had previously experienced in my career and actually had to start using `git` in a more professional capacity.
After leaving the [CyVerse](https://cyverse.org/) NSF project, I took my toolbox on the road and advocated for `git` adoption at another employer.
Little did I know that part of moving to `git` at this company was my suddenly being in charge of self-hosting GitLab via [ESXi](https://www.vmware.com/products/cloud-infrastructure/esxi-and-esx) hosted virtual machines and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) behind the company firewall in a blade server in my cubicle.
I was completely hooked on hardware/self-hosting after this.

More recently I've tinkered with simple Raspberry Pi clusters inspired by people like [Jeff Geerling](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/), which led to many home projects.
I recently assembled an [ARM64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AArch64) small board computer low-power self-hosted git server with [Gitea](https://about.gitea.com/), [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), and a little firewall networking black magic.
Seems like Gitea will adequately reproduce the [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) experience without the memory overhead of GitLab.
This has led to a lot of home projects surrounding small, contained services, utilizing automation tools like [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/).

# Self-Hosting Limitations

I think the biggest limitation, as a buddy of mine pointed out, is that now you have to maintain all this infrastructure—the hardware, the code, the databases, all of it.
If you also happen to do this as a day job, it can get taxing. Sometimes I've had to step away from my own projects AND work to go outside and touch grass.
You also probably need more than an Internet Service Provider (ISP) supplied gateway/router to get started.
Some ISPs may lock you in to using their gateway (this happened to someone I know who had a fiber optic connection).
If you work or study in an academic lab, you are probably at the behest of your IT department, so getting outside access to your services might be tricky.


# Parting Thoughts

If you want total creative, operational, and technical control—maybe you bootstrap everything yourself.
There's a middle ground here: by mixing and matching commercially available products and rolling your own services, you might get better results than your gateway alone.
I've taken the longer road in terms of "smart home" projects and have methodically expanded the scope at various stages of my life.
This was a purposeful decision, and I think it's kind of fun to take a little moment every day and look at something you really put effort into because it was fun and you learned something.
Large language model (LLM, or more pejoratively "AI") self-hosting with tools like [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), [MLX](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx), etc. is definitely an interesting area I'm actively exploring.
Does self-hosting AI make it a little more sustainable? Depends on a lot of factors, most principally your LLM use case.
