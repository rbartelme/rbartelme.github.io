# The Maximalist Trap in Scientific Computing

There is a tendency in data science communities to stretch their favorite programming languages well beyond their optimal use cases.
Maybe this can be equated to a "comfort zone" problem, or it's the depth vs. breadth tendency as one climbs the STEM degree ladder.
I think both the R and Python data science and/or bioinformatics communities fall into maximalist patterns that can compromise performance and maintainability.
*When your preferred tool is R/Python, every problem can look like a dataframe (I started here too!).*
When problems are consistently distilled through the lens of a tabular dataset, or packages abstract everything away, you fundamentally miss learning where to apply more efficient data structures.


# Data Science Duality: Where R and Python Legitimately Excel
I'll admit, I learned R before Python.
My training in quantitative ecology and bioinformatics necessitated a moderate amount of [shell scripting](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html) with a heavy dose of R + tabular count data.
I too was an R maximalist for a while.
Exploratory data analysis is still easier for me in R due to familiarity, but as I collaborated on python codebases I began to appreciate the python ecosystem more.
Python does not really follow a quasi-functional programming paradigm like R's [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/).
R does not use [object class methods](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html) as heavily as python's ecosystem, which I personally found to be the most difficult concept to master since R end users rarely build object classes with methods.

## R in the Statistical Domain
R's power lies in its statistical distribution simulation, Bayesian inference ecosystem, and one line linear regression capabilities.
The Bioconductor packages use all these great traits for bioinformatics applications.
For example, simulating a negative binomial distribution in python requires an external package, [numpy](https://numpy.org/) and looks like this:

```python
import numpy as np

# set seed
np.random.seed(42)

# distribution parameters
n = 10 # number of successes
p = 0.3 # probability of success

# generate sample distribution with 1000 samples
samples = np.random.negative_binomial(n, p, size=1000) 
```

While we can do the same thing in base R without any external package imports

```R
# set seed
set.seed(42)

# parameters
s <- 10 # successes (changed for clarity in the function that follows)
p <- 0.3 # probability of success 

# Generate distribution with our parameters
# Note: in this case n = 1000 samples, hence the variable assignment change
samples <- rnbinom(n = 1000, size = s, prob = p)

```

If we want to extend this to counts data, like in RNAseq analyses, we'll require [`scipy.stats`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html) in python and [`MASS`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MASS/index.html) in R.
Instead of successes (n or s) and probability of success (p), the counts case changes our simulation parameters to mean (Î¼) and dispersion (r).
I digress--the point being, a lot of statistical research ends up in R first.
[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) is also very robust for creating figures quickly and iteratively through functional programming paradigms.

## Python's versatility sweet spots
Admittedly, if you talk to me lately I sound like a shill for "Big Python".
I think I appreciate it for general purpose scripting and automation of tasks.
[`argparse`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) is delightful to work with and I made my first "real" command-line interface (CLI) program with it.
Python also gets the most depth in terms of machine learning and AI extensibility (ex. [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/), [torch](https://pytorch.org/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), and much more).
Application Program Interface (API) development and web services are made significantly easier.
I found working with [R shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) to be a miserable experience, but your mileage may vary. 


# The Hidden Costs of Maximalism

Specialization is great until it isn't.
Consider each programming language as an island community.
We can say that each programming language community yields its own paradigms and best practices on their islands.
Maybe on each "programming langauge island" their are special needs or the language randomly asserts itself.
As a trained ecologist, this reminds me of [niche theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_niche) vs. [neutral theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_neutral_theory_of_biodiversity).
Briefly, niche theory asserts that species have unique and defined ecological niches, while neutral theory allows for randomized functional equivalency and similar chances of survival.
Consider language maximalism representative of niche theory--hyperspecialized, and adept at bending a particular language to one's goals.
The polyglot approach to data science coding allows for functional equivalency and robust problem solving.

## The R and Python Overlap
There is a lot of functional overlap between R and Python--differing only in syntax.
Some examples: Data manipulation (tidyverse vs pandas), Visualization (ggplot2 vs matplotlib/seaborn)
In my experience the choice then becomes driven by preference rather than necessity.
Sometimes using both can produce interesting results [see this blogpost](https://medium.com/@ben.roston/r-vs-python-more-like-r-and-python-4f015fa57b6a).

## Performance penalties at scale
Memory management in R for large genomic datasets can be poor (need a good example here??), but can be equally poor in python, ex. [pysam]()
Python was designed on single core CPU's and therefore has many limitations for parallel processing.
This is hampered by the [global interpreter lock (GIL for short)]().
The GIL's purpose in modern python is [hotly debated](), since it requires complex module management and a deeper understanding of [concurrency]() and [parallelism]()
- Need a Case study: Genome assembly pipelines hitting language limits

## Maintenance and technical debt
Sometimes you need bits of many languages to build something interesting and the programmatic link between languages might be more common than you think.
A lot of scripting languages like R and Python are [syntactic sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar) that make calls behind the scenes to other languages via foreign function interfaces.
For example, a lot of R packages call C++ via `Rcpp` and FORTRAN subroutines via the `.Fortran()` base R function.
In Python, we can call Rust code via `pyo3` or use R code via `rpy2`.
These interoperations are complex in my personal experience, but if you've read this far you're probably curious enough to continue.

## Innovation bottlenecks
Language maximalism is missing out on emerging tools and paradigms.
There are complex work arounds for language limitations and difficulty onboarding team members when the codebase spans many languages.
However, many langauges wrap others for performance purposes as I previously described 
If you don't know python, it's hard to stay on the bleeding edge of LLM's, AI, etc., since academic research is often siloed here.
Reinventing wheels that exist in other ecosystems is a huge time cost.
Consider making an R library to do something that already exists in python, by the time CRAN approves it, you could have spent time learning python!!

## Complexity as a Case Against Polyglot Programming
Doesn't polyglot programming add to cognitive overhead and maintenance complexity??
Yes, but sometimes learning other approaches/languages makes you appreciate the features of your favorite languages more.
Learning another language might inspire you to mix and match like Ben Roston's article above.
What data scientists and bioinformaticians do is complex in nature and growing your skills is paramount to longevity in a rapidly changing field.

# The Polyglot Advantage: Strategic Language Selection


## Performance-critical components
- C/C++ for algorithmic cores (alignment, variant calling)
- Rust for memory-safe systems programming
- Go for concurrent processing pipelines
- GPU languages (CUDA/OpenCL) or language wrappers for massively parallel tasks

## Data engineering layer
- Scala/Java for Spark clusters
- SQL for what it's designed for (not forcing everything through dataframes)
- Shell scripting for simple file operations (not subprocess.call())

## Modern infrastructure
- JavaScript/TypeScript for interactive visualizations
- Domain-specific languages (DSLs) for configuration
- Appropriate workflow managers for specific contexts

# Breaking Free: Practical Polyglot Strategies

## Identifying maximalist anti-patterns
Performance profiling languages reveals their breaking points
- Team velocity slows due to language-fighting code
- "We need a package for that" becomes too frequent

## Gradual adoption patterns
- Microservices approach: each service in its optimal language
- Pipeline decomposition: right tool for each step

## Team and cultural considerations
- Overcoming "not invented here" syndrome
- Building bridges between R and Python camps
- Establishing polyglot best practices

## Recognizing language biases in ourselves
- R vs. Python debates miss the point
- Each language as a tool, not an identity

## Building complementary skill sets
- Learning languages that fill gaps, not duplicating capabilities
- Focus on paradigms, not just syntax

## Community benefits
- Cross-pollination of ideas between ecosystems
- Better collaboration across teams with different backgrounds
