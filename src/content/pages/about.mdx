# About Ryan Bartelme
I am a full-stack data scientist with expertise in bioinformatics, algorithms, scientific computing cloud infrastructure and microbiology. I'm the founder of Informatic Edge, LLC, where I provide data science consulting and develop computational solutions for research institutions and biotechnology companies.

## Education
Ph.D. in Freshwater Science - University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee
Dissertation: "Cultivating Ecosystems: Microbial Communities in Recirculating Aquaculture Systems"
B.S. in Microbiology - University of Wisconsin-Madison
Undergraduate researcher, Co-President ASM Microbiology Club

## Professional Experience
My career has evolved from PhD researcher to postdoc educator to industry data scientist and now consultant. During my doctoral work, I pioneered computational approaches to microbial ecology in aquaculture systems, publishing five papers and supervising undergraduate researchers. As a postdoctoral researcher and data scientist, I led national-scale education programs and developed machine learning models for agricultural genomics applications. Transitioning to industry, I specialized in computer vision algorithms for medical diagnostics and advanced bioinformatics pipeline development, serving as technical lead for cloud-based genomic analysis platforms and developing proprietary algorithms for bacterial product assays.

## Technical Expertise
**Programming & Tools:** Python, R, Rust, Docker, AWS, PostgreSQL, Nextflow, machine learning (PyTorch, TensorFlow, sklearn)
**Biological Applications:** Microbial ecology, genomics, bioinformatics workflows, computer vision for biological systems, environmental monitoring

## Philosophy
I bridge biology and technology through rigorous statistical thinking and systems-level approaches. My work emphasizes methodological rigor, practical impact, and translating complex biological systems into computational solutions that drive scientific discovery and competitive advantages.

## Beyond the Lab

When I'm not developing algorithms or analyzing data, I enjoy exploring the mathematical beauty underlying natural systems. I'm particularly fascinated by how computational approaches can reveal hidden patterns in biological processes and help us design more sustainable technologies. I also enjoy analog photography, mountain biking, and hiking in the mountains.
