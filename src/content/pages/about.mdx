# About Ryan Bartelme

I am a full-stack data scientist with a penchant for bioinformatics and a love of algorithms, mathematics, statistics, computer science, AI, and their application to biological problem spaces. I'm the founder of **Informatic Edge, LLC**, where I provide comprehensive data science & bioinformatics consulting, project-based contracting, and develop data-driven solutions for research institutions and biotechnology companies.

## Education

### Doctoral Studies
I hold a doctorate in **Freshwater Science** from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee School of Freshwater Sciences, where I worked under Dr. Ryan J. Newton. My interdisciplinary dissertation encompassed:

- Microbiology and microbial ecology
- Data science and computational biology  
- Aquacultural engineering
- Information theory and quantitative ecology

My dissertation, *"Cultivating Ecosystems: Microbial Communities in Recirculating Aquaculture Systems"*, pioneered computational approaches to understanding how operational management practices and systems engineering affect microbial community composition in intensive cultivation systems.

### Undergraduate Foundation
I earned a Bachelor of Science in **Microbiology** from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I was:
- Undergraduate researcher in the Medical Microbiology and Immunology Department
- Co-President of the ASM Undergraduate Microbiology Club

## Professional Experience

### Postdoctoral Leadership at CyVerse
My postdoctoral work at the University of Arizona and CyVerse.org transformed me from researcher to educator and infrastructure developer:

- **Curriculum Development**: Completely redeveloped and led CyVerse's Docker Container Camp, training hundreds of academic researchers in containerization technologies
- **Software Carpentries Certified Instructor**: Delivered evidence-based computational training to researchers across disciplines
- **USDA AG2PI Leadership**: Founded and directed the Education, Outreach, and Training programming in Data Science for the USDA Agricultural Genome to Phenome Initiative
- **Data Management Consulting**: Facilitated data management plan creation, designed data warehousing solutions, and developed metadata management strategies for industry and academic partners
- **Cyberinfrastructure Development**: Built scalable infrastructure for computational biology workloads on cloud and HPC systems

This experience established me as a leader in computational biology education and gave me unique insights into the challenges researchers face when adopting new technologies.

### Industry Experience
Building on my academic foundation, I transitioned to industry where I worked as a Bioinformatic Data Scientist developing sustainable computational solutions that reduce cloud compute costs and resource utilization. I contributed to innovative tools and methodologies for biotechnology R&D, translating complex biological systems into computational models and data-driven solutions across both academic and industry settings.

## Current Work: Informatic Edge, LLC

My diverse background naturally led to founding Informatic Edge, where I combine deep biological domain knowledge with cutting-edge computational methods, statistical rigor, and a passion for solving complex problems through algorithmic thinking.

## Philosophy

I believe that the most transformative solutions emerge when deep domain expertise meets algorithmic innovation. By combining biological insight with mathematical rigor, statistical thinking, and computational creativity, we can tackle the most challenging problems in biology, agriculture, and environmental science.

My approach emphasizes:
- **Methodological Rigor**: Every analysis should be statistically sound and computationally reproducible
- **Practical Impact**: Research should translate into real-world benefits and actionable insights
- **Educational Excellence**: Knowledge transfer and capacity building are essential for sustainable progress
- **Continuous Innovation**: Staying at the forefront of AI, algorithms, and computational methods

## Beyond the Lab

When I'm not developing algorithms or analyzing data, I enjoy exploring the mathematical beauty underlying natural systems. I'm particularly fascinated by how computational approaches can reveal hidden patterns in biological processes and help us design more sustainable technologies. I also enjoy analog photography, mountain biking, and hiking in the mountains.
