# About Ryan Bartelme

I am a data professional working to create sustainable solutions for agricultural, medical, and environmental big data challenges. Currently, I work as a Bioinformatic Scientist at **Pivot Bio** within the Research and Development department, focusing on collaborative projects aimed at developing sustainable nitrogen solutions for agriculture.

## Professional Background

*"I live on Earth at present, and I don't know what I am. I know that I am not a category. I am not a thing — a noun. I seem to be a verb, an evolutionary process – an integral function of the universe."* — R. Buckminster Fuller

My scientific and technological interests are ever-evolving. I'm always striving to learn new technologies and methods from a systems perspective. With interdisciplinary skills rooted in biology and agriculture, I'm a quick learner who has expanded into data science and engineering. Statistics and statistical thinking drive my work, and I welcome an agile work environment that encourages growth in knowledge and technical skills.

### Current Role at Pivot Bio

At Pivot Bio, I contribute to developing sustainable nitrogen solutions that reduce agriculture's environmental impact while maintaining crop productivity. My work involves:

- **Computational Biology**: Analyzing microbial genomes and metabolic pathways
- **Data Science**: Developing predictive models for agricultural applications  
- **Bioinformatics**: Processing and interpreting large-scale biological datasets
- **Statistical Analysis**: Designing experiments and analyzing results from field trials

## Education & Research

### Doctoral Studies
I hold a doctorate in **Freshwater Science** from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee School of Freshwater Sciences, where I worked under Dr. Ryan J. Newton. The Freshwater Science doctoral program is highly interdisciplinary, and my dissertation spanned:

- Microbiology and microbial ecology
- Data science and computational biology  
- Aquacultural engineering
- Information theory and quantitative ecology

My dissertation, *"Cultivating Ecosystems: Microbial Communities in Recirculating Aquaculture Systems"*, examined how operational management practices affect microbial community composition in intensive fish cultivation systems.

### Undergraduate Education
I earned a Bachelor of Science in **Microbiology** from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I was:
- Undergraduate researcher in the Medical Microbiology and Immunology Department
- Co-President of the ASM Undergraduate Microbiology Club

### Postdoctoral Experience
My postdoctoral work at the University of Arizona spanned multiple fields:
- Data science and information theory
- Quantitative ecology
- Microbial physiology
- Cyberinfrastructure development

## Technical Expertise

As comfortable coding as with a pipette or soldering iron, I'm actively engaged in researching applications of:

- **Machine Learning**: Classical ML and deep learning for biological problems
- **Computer Vision**: Image analysis for biological applications
- **DevOps**: Scientific application deployment and containerization
- **Data Engineering**: Large-scale biological data processing pipelines

### Teaching & Outreach

I've taught intensive workshops to academic and private sector audiences on:
- Containerization of applications using Docker
- Data engineering and management (ontologies and provenance)
- Statistical programming
- Version control systems
- Curriculum development for USDA Agricultural Genomes to Phenomes Initiative

## Research Interests

My work sits at the intersection of several exciting fields:

### Microbial Ecology
Understanding how microbial communities function in agricultural and environmental systems, particularly how they can be leveraged for sustainable practices.

### Agricultural Data Science  
Applying computational methods to solve real-world farming challenges, from optimizing nutrient delivery to predicting crop outcomes.

### Sustainable Agriculture
Developing data-driven approaches to reduce agriculture's environmental footprint while maintaining productivity and profitability.

### Bioinformatics Infrastructure
Building robust, scalable systems for processing and analyzing biological data in research and production environments.

## Philosophy

I believe that the most impactful science happens at the intersection of disciplines. By combining biological insight with computational power and statistical rigor, we can address some of the most pressing challenges facing agriculture and the environment today.

My approach emphasizes:
- **Reproducible research**: All analyses should be transparent and replicable
- **Practical applications**: Research should ultimately benefit real-world systems
- **Collaborative science**: The best solutions emerge from diverse perspectives
- **Continuous learning**: Technology and methods evolve rapidly, requiring lifelong education

## Beyond the Lab

When I'm not analyzing data or writing code, I enjoy exploring the intersection of technology and sustainability in everyday life. I'm fascinated by how computational approaches can be applied to personal and community challenges, from optimizing energy usage to understanding local ecosystems.
