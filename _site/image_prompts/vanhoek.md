A detailed, hand-drawn illustration in the style of Antoni van Leeuwenhoek's 17th-century scientific drawings, depicting a computer network. The artwork should resemble the intricate, precise line work typical of Leeuwenhoek's style, using ink on aged paper. It should feature elements of a modern computer network, like routers, cables, servers, and nodes, all drawn with the same attention to detail and scientific accuracy that Leeuwenhoek applied to his microscopic observations.
