<p>“<em>I live on Earth at present, and I don’t know what I am.</em>
<em>I know that I am not a category.</em>
<em>I am not a thing — a noun.</em>
<em>I seem to be a verb, an evolutionary process – an integral function of the universe.</em>”</p>

<p><strong>—R. Buckminster Fuller</strong>

Primarily, I’m interested in how microorganisms act as the minimum information processing units in systems. I’m always striving to learn new technologies and methods from a systems perspective. With my interdisciplinary skills rooted in biology and agriculture, I’m a quick learner who’s expanded into engineering and data science. Statistics and statistical thinking drives my work, and I welcome an agile work environment that encourages growth in knowledge and technical skills. As comfortable coding as with a pipette or soldering iron, I am actively engaged in expanding my understanding of computer vision, deep learning, and classical machine learning schema.</p>

I hold a doctorate in Freshwater Science from the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee <a href="https://uwm.edu/freshwater/">School of Freshwater Sciences</a>. My doctoral advisor was <a href="https://www.newtonlabuwm.org/">Dr. Ryan J. Newton</a>. The Freshwater Science program is interdisciplinary and my <a href="https://dc.uwm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2750&amp;context=etd">dissertation</a> spanned the fields of microbiology, microbial ecology, data science, computational biology, and aquacultural engineering. My Microbiology Bachelor of Science was obtained from the University of Wisconsin - Madison, where I was an undegraduate researcher in the Medical Microbiology and Immunology Department as well as the Co-President of the ASM Undergraduate Microbiology club.</p>
