I'm always striving to learn new technologies and methods from a systems perspective. With my interdisciplinary skills rooted in biology and agriculture, I'm a quick learner who's expanded into engineering and data science. Statistics and statistical thinking drives my work, and I welcome an agile work environment that encourages growth in knowledge and technical skills. As comfortable coding as with a pipette or soldering iron, I am actively engaged in expanding my understanding of computer vision, deep learning, and classical machine learning schema.

I did my doctorate in Freshwater Science with [Dr. Ryan J. Newton](https://www.newtonlabuwm.org/) at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee [School of Freshwater Sciences](https://uwm.edu/freshwater/).
