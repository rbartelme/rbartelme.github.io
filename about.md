Ryan is a scientist and technologist who thrives at the intersection of biology and data science. His work spans from wet lab research to cloud infrastructure, always with an eye toward solving real biological problems through computational approaches.

Currently bridging academia and industry, Ryan brings expertise in bioinformatics, data engineering, DevOps, and AI/machine learning to biological research challenges. His background gives him a unique perspective on how statistical thinking and systems approaches can transform scientific workflows.

As a Bioinformatics Scientist, Ryan worked on constraint-based metabolic modeling and RNAseq algorithm development. He served as the principal architect for a major Nextflow DSL2 pipeline infrastructure refactor, designing cloud-native systems with data lakehouse architecture that synthesized modern cloud stack approaches with scientific computing workflows.

In his previous role as an R&D Computer Vision Algorithm Developer, Ryan collaborated across interdisciplinary teams on diagnostic technology projects. He also spearheaded Git adoption and DevOps practices while managing infrastructure for computer vision applications in research environments. His work also encompassed statistical process control for *in vitro* medical diagnostics, bringing his statistical thinking background to quality assurance and R&D process optimization.

His work with the NSF's [CyVerse](https://www.cyverse.org/) Cyberinfrastructure Institute focused on DevOps integrations for scientific applications running on Kubernetes. Ryan also developed and led workshops for academic and industry audiences, covering everything from Docker containers and data engineering to statistical programming and version controlâ€”work that supported the USDA's [Agricultural Genomes to Phenomes Initiative](https://www.ag2pi.org/).

Ryan's academic foundation is equally interdisciplinary. His postdoctoral research at the University of Arizona explored data science applications in quantitative ecology and microbial physiology. He earned his PhD in Freshwater Science from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee's [School of Freshwater Sciences](https://uwm.edu/freshwater/), working with [Dr. Ryan J. Newton](https://www.newtonlabuwm.org/) on research that combined microbiology, computational biology, and aquacultural engineering.

His journey began with a BS in Microbiology from UW-Madison, where he conducted undergraduate research in Medical Microbiology and Immunology while serving as Co-President of the ASM Undergraduate Microbiology Club. Throughout his career, Ryan has remained committed to the idea that the most interesting problems exist at the boundaries between disciplines.
