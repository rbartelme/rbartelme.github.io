"*I live on Earth at present, and I don’t know what I am.*
*I know that I am not a category.*
*I am not a thing — a noun.*
*I seem to be a verb, an evolutionary process – an integral function of the universe.*"

**—R. Buckminster Fuller**

Ryan's scientific and technological interests are ever evolving. He is always striving to learn new technologies and methods from a systems perspective. With his interdisciplinary skills rooted in biology and agriculture, he's a quick learner who has expanded into data science and engineering. Statistics and statistical thinking drives his work, and he welcomes an agile work environment that encourages growth in knowledge and technical skills. As comfortable coding as with a pipette or soldering iron, he is actively engaged in researching the applications of computer vision, deep learning, and classical machine learning schema to biological problems.

In his time at the NSF's [CyVerse](https://www.cyverse.org/) Cyberinfrastructure Insitute, Ryan did DevOps integrations for scientific applications on CyVerse's self-hosted Kubernetes Discovery Environment. Additonally, he taught intensive workshops to a variety of academic and private sector audiences on topics such as: containerization of applications using Docker; data engineering; data managment (ontologies and provenance); statistical programming; version control; and managed curriculum development for the United States Department of Agriculture [Agricultural Genomes to Phenomes Initiative](https://www.ag2pi.org/).

His postdoctoral work at the University of Arizona spanned the fields of data science, information theory, quantitative ecology, and microbial physiology. Ryan holds a doctorate in Freshwater Science from the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee [School of Freshwater Sciences](https://uwm.edu/freshwater/). His doctoral advisor was [Dr. Ryan J. Newton](https://www.newtonlabuwm.org/). The Freshwater Science doctoral program is highly interdisciplinary and his [dissertation](https://dc.uwm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2750&context=etd) spanned the fields of microbiology, microbial ecology, data science, computational biology, and aquacultural engineering. Ryan also holds a Bachelor of Science in microbiology from the University of Wisconsin - Madison, where he was an undegraduate researcher in the Medical Microbiology and Immunology Department as well as the Co-President of the ASM Undergraduate Microbiology club.
