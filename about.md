"*I live on Earth at present, and I don’t know what I am.*
*I know that I am not a category.*
*I am not a thing — a noun.*
*I seem to be a verb, an evolutionary process – an integral function of the universe.*"

**—R. Buckminster Fuller**

My scientific and technological interests are ever evolving. I'm always striving to learn new technologies and methods from a systems perspective. With my interdisciplinary skills rooted in biology and agriculture, I'm a quick learner who's expanded into engineering and data science. Statistics and statistical thinking drives my work, and I welcome an agile work environment that encourages growth in knowledge and technical skills. As comfortable coding as with a pipette or soldering iron, I am actively engaged in researching the applications of computer vision, deep learning, and classical machine learning schema to biological problems.

In my time at the NSF's [CyVerse](https://www.cyverse.org/) Cyberinfrastructure Insitute, I did DevOps integrations for scientific applications on CyVerse's self-hosted Kubernetes Discovery Environment. Additonally, I taught intensive workshops to a variety of academic and private sector audiences on topics like: containerization of applications using Docker; data engineering; data managment (ontologies and provenance); statistical programming; version control; and managed curriculum development for the United States Department of Agriculture [Agricultural Genomes to Phenomes Initiative](https://www.ag2pi.org/).

My postdoctoral work at the University of Arizona spanned the fields of data science, information theory, quantitative ecology, and microbial physiology. I hold a doctorate in Freshwater Science from the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee [School of Freshwater Sciences](https://uwm.edu/freshwater/). My doctoral advisor was [Dr. Ryan J. Newton](https://www.newtonlabuwm.org/). The Freshwater Science program is interdisciplinary and my [dissertation](https://dc.uwm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2750&context=etd) spanned the fields of microbiology, microbial ecology, data science, computational biology, and aquacultural engineering. My Microbiology Bachelor of Science was obtained from the University of Wisconsin - Madison, where I was an undegraduate researcher in the Medical Microbiology and Immunology Department as well as the Co-President of the ASM Undergraduate Microbiology club.
